In this topic I propose a small macro function I'm using to manage comment variables that report multiples comments. 
Let's say you've got a variables "issues" that must report all issues encountered during the processing of a file: file extension, file nampe pattern, file strucure, variables formats and so on.
It can be messy to do that manually, so instead I suggest to use a function that will automatically appends some content to an existing value, using a predefined delimiter.

```
%macro add_com(com, txt);
    &com. = catx('; ', &com., &txt.);
%mend;
```

Easy, isn't it? The logic is very simple: **catx** concatenate parameters using the 1st parameter as the delimiter (here, a semi-colon).   
What's interesting with catx is if a parameter is missing, it is skipped:  
* if `&com` is empty, it will contain only `&txt` value
* if `&txt` is null, `&com` will remain unchanged. 
* If both are provided, you will get the original value of `&com`, followed by a `; `, followed by `&txt`

```
%macro add_com(com, txt);
    &com. = catx('; ', &com., &txt.);
%mend;

data test;
    attrib issue format=$500.;
	
    *-- Simulate stuff --*;
    %add_com(issue, ""); output;                    /* Issue = "" */
    %add_com(issue, "There is a problem"); output;  /* Issue = "There is a problem" */
    %add_com(issue, "This is wrong"); output;       /* Issue = "There is a problem; This is wrong" */
    %add_com(issue, "Another one");	output;         /* Issue = "There is a problem; This is wrong; Another one" */
run;
```
