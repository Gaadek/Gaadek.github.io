This macro function allows to clear a library, i.e. delete all datasets within.  
I use it mainly to clear the work library at the and of a process, to ensure there are no remaining data for the following SAS process. This avoid to close/restart the current SAS seesion.  

## Sample
```
%clear_lib(work)
```
The code above will delete all the SAS datasets from the `work` library.

## Code
```
*-- Macro to clear a SAS library --*;
%macro clear_lib(lib);
    proc sql noprint;
		    select      count(*)
        into        :memcount
        from        dictionary.tables
        where       libname=upcase("&lib")
        ;
    quit;

    *-- Clear library only if members are inside and no SAS error --*;
	  %if %eval(&memcount) > 0 %then %do;
		    proc datasets library=&lib. kill nolist; run; quit;
	  %end;
%mend clear_lib;
```
