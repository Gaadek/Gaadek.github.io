Today is time to clean your laptop. When, like me, you use Docker to test plenty of things, you may notice it uses disk space. After few months, it may represent a lot of lost space, so let's track and remove unused Docker stuff!

## Containers
First of all, to list all containers:
```bash
docker ps -a
```

And to remove all non running containers:
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -qa)
```

To remove all exited containers with their volumes:
To remove all unused containers, including their volumen, you can run this:
```bash
docker rm -v $(docker ps -aqf status=exited)
```

## Volumes
First of all, to list volumes:
```bash
docker volume ls
```

You can remove volumes for containers that does not exist anymore:
```bash
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
```

## Images
First of all, to list images:
```bash
docker image ls
```

To delete intermediate images (used to build another images):
```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -qf dangling=true)
```

To delete all images not used by any container: 
```bash
docker image prune -a
```

If the previous command is too hardcore, you can use this one:
```bash
docker image prune -a --force --filter "until=2017-01-04T00:00:00"
```
It will delete all images created **before** 04JAN2017
